00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.000
hello world my name is David J Ma and

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.920
I'm a professor of computer science at

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.360
Harvard University today I've been asked

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.160
to explain algorithms in five levels of

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.559
increasing difficulty algorithms are

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
important because they really are

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.039
everywhere not only in the physical

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.800
world but certainly in the virtual world

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.520
as well and in fact what excites me

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.359
about algorithms is that they really

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.240
represent an opportunity to solve

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.279
problems and I dare say no matter what

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.240
you do in life all of us have problems

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.599
to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.119
solve so I'm a computer science

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.800
professor so I spend a lot of time with

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.399
computerss how would you define a

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.800
computer for them well a computer is

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:43.239
electronic like a phone but it's um a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.000
rectangle and you like can type like

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.640
tick tick tick and you work on it nice

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.079
do you know any of the parts that are

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.879
inside of a computer um no can I explain

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.199
a couple of them to you yeah so like

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.320
inside of every computer is some kind of

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.399
brain and the technical term for that is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.400
CPU or Central processing unit and those

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.439
are the pieces of Hardware that know how

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.200
to respond to those instructions like

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.280
moving up or down or left or right knows

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.720
how to do math like addition and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.000
subtraction and then there's at least

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.320
one other type of Hardware inside of a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.520
computer called memory or Ram if you've

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.799
heard of this I know memory because you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.400
have to memorize stuff yeah exactly and

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.320
computers have even different types of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.840
memory they have what's called Ram

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.560
random access memory which is where your

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.600
games where your programs are stored

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.840
while they being used but then it also

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.360
has a a hard drive or a solid state

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.320
drive which is where your data your high

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.360
scores your documents once you start

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.600
writing essays and and stories in the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.040
future stays there stays permanently so

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.360
even if the power goes out the computer

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.920
can still remember that information it's

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.040
still there because the computer can't

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.960
just like delete all the words itself

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.159
because your fingers can only do that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.920
like you have to use your finger to

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.920
delete all the stuff exactly have you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.920
heard of an algorithm before um yes

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.200
algorithm is a list of instructions to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.360
tell people what to do or like a robot

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.120
what to do yeah exactly it's so it's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.280
just stepbystep instructions for doing

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.560
something for solving a problem for yeah

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.120
so like if you have a bedtime routine

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.319
then first you say I get dressed I brush

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.040
my teeth I read a little story and then

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.879
I go to bed all right well how about

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.920
another algorithm like um what do you

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.959
tend to eat for for lunch any types of

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.360
sandwiches you like uh I eat peanut

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.200
butter and let me get some supplies from

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.000
the cupboard here so should we make an

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.560
algorithm together for why don't we do

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.920
it this way why don't we pretend like

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.159
I'm a computer or maybe I'm a robot so I

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.879
only understand your instructions and so

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.840
I want you to feed me no pun intended an

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.080
algorithm so step-by-step instructions

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.800
for solving this problem but remember

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.360
algorithms you have to be precise you

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.200
have to give the right instructions the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.400
right instructions just do it for me

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.159
soep step one was what open the bag okay

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.959
opening the bag of bread stop now grab

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.360
the bread and put it on the plate grab

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.440
the bread and put it on the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.360
plate take all the bread back and put it

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.120
back in there so that's like an undo

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.560
command little control Z okay take one

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.519
bread and put it on the plate take the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.239
lid off the peanut butter okay take the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.760
lid off the peanut butter put the lid

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.319
down okay take the knife take the knife

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.920
put the blade inside the peanut butter

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.720
and spread the peanut butter on the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.599
bread I'm going to take out some peanut

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.360
butter and I'm going to spread the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.920
peanut butter on the bread I put a lot

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.360
of peanut butter on because I love

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.680
peanut butter apparently I thought I was

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.400
messing with you here but I think you're

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.159
happy with this Put The Knife down and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.879
then grab one bread and put it on top of

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.079
the second bread

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.120
sideways

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.879
sideways like put it flat on oh flat

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.799
ways okay and now done you're done with

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.400
your sandwich should we take a delicious

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.480
bite yep let's take a bite okay here we

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.560
go what would be the next step be you

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.000
here clean all this mess up clean all

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.040
this mess up right we made an algorithm

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.880
step-by-step instructions for solving

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.400
some problem and if you think about now

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.880
how we made peanut butter and jelly

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.120
sandwiches sometimes we were imprecise

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.400
you didn't give me quite enough

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.880
information to do the algorithm

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.120
correctly and that's why I took out so

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.120
much bread Precision being very very

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.840
correct with your instructions is so

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.560
important in the real world because for

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.919
instance when you're using the worldwide

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.800
web and you're searching for something

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.960
on Google or being you want to do the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.919
right thing so like if you type in just

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.759
Google then you won't find the answer to

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.720
your question pretty much everything we

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.479
do in life is an algorithm even if we

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.600
don't use that fancy word to describe it

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.440
because you and I are sort of following

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.880
instructions either that we came up with

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.600
ourselves or maybe our parents told us

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.400
how to do these things and so those are

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.919
just algorithms but when you start using

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.360
algorithms in uh computers that's when

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.360
you start writing

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.639
code what do you know about algorithms

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.280
nothing really um at all honestly I

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.960
think it's just probably a way to store

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.319
information um in computers and I dare

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.680
say even though you might not have put

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:25.039
this word on it odds are you executed as

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.680
a human multiple algorithms today even

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.560
before you came here today like what

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.199
were a few things that you did I got

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.440
ready okay and get ready what does that

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.720
mean brushing my teeth brushing my hair

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.039
okay put getting dressed okay so all of

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.160
those frankly if we really um Dove more

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.800
deeply could be broken down into

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.000
stepbystep instructions and presumably

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.160
your mom your dad someone in the past

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.120
sort of programmed you as a human to

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.720
know what to do and then after that as a

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.759
smart human you can sort of take it from

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.919
there and you don't need their help

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.160
anymore but that's kind of what we're

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.880
doing when we program computer something

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.800
maybe even more familiar nowadays like

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.840
odds are you have a cell phone your

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.240
contacts or your dress book but let me

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.639
ask you why that is like why does Apple

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.440
or Google or anyone else bother

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.240
alphabetizing your contacts I just

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.039
assumed it would be easier to navigate

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.720
what if your friend happened to be at

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.319
the very bottom of this randomly

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.160
organized list like why is that a

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.400
problem like he or she is still there I

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.919
guess it would take a while to get to

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.400
while you're scrolling that in of itself

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.280
is kind of a problem or it's an

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.840
inefficient solution to the problem so

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.440
it turns out that back in my day before

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.199
there were cell phones like everyone's

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.960
numbers from high schools like were

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.919
literally printed in a book and everyone

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.639
in my town and my city my state was

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.400
printed in an actual phone book even if

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.880
you've never seen this technology before

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.280
how would you propose verbally to find

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.280
John in this phone book or I would just

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.840
flip through and just look for the J I

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.360
guess yeah so let me propose that we

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.639
start that way I could just start at the

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.360
beginning and step by step I could just

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.319
look at each page looking for John

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.160
looking for John now even if you've

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.599
never seen this here technology before

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.319
it turns out this is exactly what your

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:57.479
phone could be doing in software like

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:59.000
someone from Google or Apple or the like

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.160
they could write software that uses a

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.960
technique in programming known as a loop

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.639
and a loop as the word implies is just

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.800
sort of do something again and again

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.120
what if instead of starting from the

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.039
beginning and going one page at a time

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.280
what if I or what if your phone goes

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:13.440
like two pages or two names at a time

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.440
would this be correct do you think well

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.240
you could skip over John I think in what

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.120
sense if he's in one of the middle pages

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.199
that you skipped over yeah so sort of

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.840
accidentally and frankly with like 50/50

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:24.720
probability John could get sandwiched in

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.039
between two pages but does that mean I

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.919
have to throw that algorithm out alt

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:30.240
together maybe you could use that

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.599
strategy until you get close to the

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.080
section and then switch to going one by

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:35.000
one okay that's nice so you could kind

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.039
of like go twice as fast but then kind

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.919
of pump the brakes as you near your exit

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:41.000
on the highway or in this case near the

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:43.520
J section of the book exactly and maybe

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.759
alternatively if I get to like a b c d e

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.720
f g h i j k if I get to the K section

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.479
then I could just double back like one

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.960
page just to make sure John didn't get

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:53.680
sandwiched between those pages so the

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.800
nice thing about that second algorithm

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.520
is that I'm flying through the phone

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.360
book like two pages at a time so 2 4 6 8

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.840
10 12 it's not perfect it's not

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.800
necessarily correct but it is if I just

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.960
take like one extra step so I think it's

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.960
fixable but what your phone is probably

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.440
doing and frankly what I and like my

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.759
parents and grandparents used to do back

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.800
in the day is we'd probably go roughly

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:13.120
to the middle of the phone book here and

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.280
just intuitively if this is an

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.560
alphabetized phone book in English what

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.800
section am I probably going to find

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.280
myself in roughly K okay so I'm in the K

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.120
section is John going to be to the left

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.319
or to the right to the left yeah so John

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.639
is going to be to the left to the right

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:27.560
and what we can do here though your

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:29.440
phone does something smarter is tear the

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.080
problem in half throw half of the

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.560
problem away being left with just 500

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.159
pages now but what might I next do I

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.479
could sort of naively just start at the

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.320
beginning again but we've learned to do

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:41.599
better I can go roughly to the middle

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.919
here do it again yeah exactly so now

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:46.640
maybe I'm in the E section which is a

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.839
little to the left so John is clearly

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.880
going to be to the right so I can again

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:53.920
tear the problem portly in half throw

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.240
this half of the problem away and I

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.959
claim now that if we started with a

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:01.200
th000 Pages now we've gone to 500 250

00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:01.200
now we're really moving quick

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.519
not on that page and I can call him

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.880
roughly how many steps might this third

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:17.519
algorithm take if I started with a th000

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:20.440
Pages then went to 500 250 125 like how

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:23.040
many times can you divide 1,000 and half

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.920
maybe 10 that's roughly 10 because in

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.519
the first algorithm looking again for

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.000
someone like Zoe in the worst case might

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:29.920
have to go all the way through thousand

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.480
pages but the second algorithm you said

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.680
was 500 maybe 500 in1 essentially the

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.519
same thing so twice as fast but this

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.560
third and final algorithm is sort of

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:40.320
fundamentally faster because you're

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.440
you're sort of dividing and conquering

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.680
it in half and half and half not just

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.440
taking one or two bites out of it at of

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.920
a time so this of course is not how we

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.200
used to use phone books back in the day

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.600
since otherwise they'd be single use

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.959
only but it is how your phone is

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.480
actually searching for zoy for John for

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:57.360
anyone else but it's doing it in

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.560
software oh that's cool so here we've

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.240
happened to focus on searching

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.040
algorithms looking for John in the phone

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.560
book but the technique we just used can

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.399
indeed be called divide and conquer

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.079
where you take a big problem and you

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:09.320
divide and conquer that is you try to

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:11.120
chop it up into smaller smaller smaller

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.560
pieces a more sophisticated type of

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.200
algorithm at least depending on how you

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.880
implement it something known as a

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.320
recursive algorithm recursive algorithm

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.600
is essentially an algorithm that uses

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.079
itself to solve the exact same problem

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.050
again and again but chops it smaller and

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:28.040
smaller and smaller

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.079
[Music]

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.560
ultimately hi my name is Patricia

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:33.560
Patricia nice to meet you where are you

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.279
a student at I'm starting my senior year

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.079
now at NYU oh nice and what have you

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:38.760
been studying the past few years I study

00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:40.560
computer science and data science if you

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.800
were chatting with a non-cs nonata

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.120
science friend of yours like how would

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.320
you explain to them what an algorithm is

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.079
some kind of like systematic way of like

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.320
solving a problem or like a set of like

00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:53.320
steps to kind of solve a certain like

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.160
problem you have so you probably recall

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.079
learning topics like binary search

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.480
versus linear search and the like so

00:10:57.079 --> 00:11:01.480
I've come here uh complete with a actual

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.839
chalkboard with some magnetic numbers on

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.480
it here like how would you tell a friend

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:07.839
to sort these I think one of the first

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.160
things we learned was something called

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:12.519
bubble sort it was kind of like focusing

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.279
on like smaller like bubbles I guess I

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:16.279
would say it like of the problem like

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:17.959
looking at like smaller segments rather

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:19.600
than like the whole thing at once what

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:21.920
is I think very true about what you're

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.000
hinting at is that bubble sort really

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.440
focuses on like local small problems

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.240
rather than taking a step back trying to

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.880
fix the whole thing let's just fix the

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.120
obvious problem in front of us so for

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.839
instance when we're trying to get from

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.320
smallest to largest and the first two

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:36.720
things we see are eight followed by one

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.600
this looks like a problem cuz it's out

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.200
of order so what would be the simplest

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.880
fix the least amount of work we can do

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.839
to at least fix one problem just like

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.560
switch those two numbers cuz one is

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:47.519
obviously smaller than eight perfect so

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.040
we just swap those two then you would

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:51.560
switch those again yeah so that further

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.320
improves the situation and you can kind

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.440
of see it that the one and the two are

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.839
now in place how about 8 and six switch

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.600
it again switch those again 8 and three

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:02.959
switch it again

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.880
and conversely now the one and the two

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:07.920
are closer to and coincidentally are

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.639
exactly where we want them to be so are

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:14.320
we done no okay so obviously not but

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:16.880
what could we do now to further improve

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.399
the situation go through it again but

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.160
like you don't need to check the last

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:22.079
one anymore because we know like that

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.560
number is bubbled up to the top Yeah

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:26.120
because it has indeed bubbled all the

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.720
way to the top so one and two yeah keep

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.440
it as is okay two and six keep it as is

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.959
okay six and three then you switch it

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.760
okay we switch or swap those six and

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:36.800
four swap it again okay so four and uh

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.320
six and seven uh keep it okay seven and

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.720
five swap it okay and then I think per

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:45.000
your point we're pretty darn close let's

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:48.000
go through once more one and two Keep It

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.720
2 three keep it 3 four keep it 4 six

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.480
keep it 6 five and then switch it all

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.920
right we'll switch this and now to your

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.519
point we don't need to bother with the

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.000
ones that already bubbled their way up

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:58.240
now we're 100% sure it's sorted yeah and

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.480
certainly the search engines of the

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.760
world Google and Bing and so forth they

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.360
probably don't keep web pages in sorted

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.560
order because that would be a crazy long

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.199
list when you're just trying to search

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.880
the data but there's probably some

00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:11.240
algorithm underlying what they do and

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.360
they probably similarly just like we do

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.160
a bit of work upfront to get things

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.880
organized even if it's not strictly

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.120
sorted in the same way so that people

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.240
like you and me and others can find that

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.560
same information so how about social

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.959
media can you Invision where the

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.720
algorithms are in that world like maybe

00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:29.360
for example like Tik Tok like the for

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.680
you page it's kind of like

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.399
cuz those are like Rec like

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.880
recommendations right it's like sort of

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:36.560
like Netflix recommendations except more

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.399
constant because it's just like every

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.880
video you scroll it's like that's a new

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:40.839
recommendation basically and it's like

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.279
based on like what you've liked

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:44.480
previously what you've like saved

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:45.760
previously what you search up so I would

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.160
assume there's some kind of algorithm

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.160
there kind of figuring out like what to

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.720
put on your foru page absolutely just

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.800
trying to keep you presumably more

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.839
engaged so the better the algorithm is

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.720
the better your engagement is maybe the

00:13:54.839 --> 00:13:58.199
more money the company then makes on the

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.560
platform and so forth so it all sort of

00:13:58.199 --> 00:14:01.800
feeds together together but what you're

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.199
describing really is more artificially

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.920
intelligent if I may because presumably

00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:07.839
there's not someone at Tik Tok or any of

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.240
these social media companies saying if

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:12.160
Patricia likes this post then show her

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.800
this post if she likes this post then

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.839
show her this other post because the

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.360
code would sort of grow infinitely long

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:19.399
and there's just way too much content

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.759
for a programmer to be having those

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:24.160
kinds of conditionals those those

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:25.279
decisions being made behind the scenes

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.040
so it's probably a little more

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:28.800
artificially intelligent and in that

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.920
sense You have topics like neuron

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.000
networks and uh machine learning which

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.680
really describe taking as input things

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.959
like what you watch what you click on

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.199
what your friends watch what they click

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:40.120
on and sort of trying to infer from that

00:14:38.199 --> 00:14:42.639
instead what should we show Patricia or

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.800
her friends next okay yeah yeah that

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:48.000
makes like the distinction more makes

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.000
more sense now

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:54.079
yeah I am currently a fourth year PhD

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.839
student at NYU I do robot learning so

00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:57.000
that's half and half Robotics and

00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:59.519
Mission learning sounds like you've

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.399
dabbled with quite a few algorith so how

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:03.480
does one actually research algorithms or

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:04.880
invent algorithms the most important was

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.759
just trying to think about

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.600
inefficiencies and also think about

00:15:06.759 --> 00:15:11.600
Connecting Threads the way I think about

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.959
it is that algorithm for me is not just

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.759
about the way of doing something but

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:16.160
it's about doing something efficiently

00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:18.480
learning algorithms are practically

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.079
everywhere now CU Google I would say for

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.639
example is learning every day about like

00:15:21.079 --> 00:15:26.519
oh what what articles with links might

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:28.120
be better than others and reranking them

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:29.160
um there are recommender systems all

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.319
around us

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.880
right like content feeds and social

00:15:31.319 --> 00:15:36.639
media or you know like YouTube or

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.279
Netflix what we see is in a large part

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:40.160
determined by this kind of learning

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:42.600
algorithms nowadays there's a lot of

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.440
concerns around some applications of

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.399
machine learning and like deep fakes

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.079
where it can kind of learn how I talk

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:50.319
and learn how you talk and even how we

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:51.600
look and generate videos of us we're

00:15:50.319 --> 00:15:53.440
doing this for real but you could

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.240
imagine a computer synthesizing this

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.560
conversation eventually but how does it

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.319
even know what I sound like and what I

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.440
look like and how to replicate that all

00:15:59.319 --> 00:16:04.519
of this learning algorithms that we talk

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.639
about right uh a lot like what goes in

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:08.560
there is just lots and lots of data so

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:10.199
data goes in something else comes out

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.560
what comes out is whatever objective

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:13.440
function that you optimize for like

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:17.319
where is the line between algorithms

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.399
that like play games with and without AI

00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:23.000
I think when I started off my undergrad

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:25.120
the current AI machine learning was not

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.199
very much synonymous okay and even in my

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.040
undergraduate in the AI class they

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:31.160
learned a lot of classical gorithms for

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.040
game plays like for example the AAR

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.240
search right that's a very simple

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.240
example of how you can play a game

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.880
without having anything learned this is

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.920
very much oh you are at a game State you

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.000
just search down see what are the

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.040
possibilities and then you pick the best

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.279
possibility that it can see versus what

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:53.199
you think about when you think about I

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:55.639
gameplay like the alpha zero for example

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:57.360
or Alpha star or there are a lot of you

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:59.519
know like fancy new machine learning

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.560
agents that are you know even like

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:04.720
learning very difficult games like go

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.959
and those are learned agents as in they

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.319
are getting better as they play more and

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:11.280
more games and as they get more games

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:13.280
they kind of refine their strategy based

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.439
on the data that they seen and once

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.199
again this high level abstraction is

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:19.600
still the same you see a lot of data and

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:21.160
you learn from that right but the

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.240
question is what is objective function

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.760
that you're optimizing for is it winning

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.039
this game is it forcing a tie or is it

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.919
you know like opening a door in a

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:31.120
kitchen so if the world is very much

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:32.720
focused on supervised unsupervised

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.720
reinforcement learning now like what

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.679
comes next 5 10 years where's the world

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.720
going I think that this is just U going

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:42.360
to be more and more I don't want to use

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.880
the word encroachment but that's what it

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.559
feels like of algorithms into our

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.200
everyday life like even when I was

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:48.840
taking the train here right the trains

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.559
are being routed with algorithms but

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.799
this has existed for you know like 50

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:55.760
years probably but as I was coming here

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:57.640
as I was checking my phone those are

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.120
different algorithms and you know

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.400
they're they're kind of getting all

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.400
around us getting they're with us all

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.000
the time they're making our life better

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.440
most places most cases and I think

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.880
that's just going to be continuation of

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.520
all of those and it feels like they're

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.159
even in places you wouldn't expect and

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.679
there's just so much data about you and

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:15.640
me and everyone else online and this

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:17.320
data is being mind and analyzed and

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.200
influencing things we see and here it

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.640
would seem so there is sort of a

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.240
Counterpoint which might be good for the

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.320
marketers but not necessarily good for

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.520
you and me as individuals you know like

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.360
we're human beings but for someone we

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.919
might be just a pair of eyes who are you

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.880
know carrying a wallet and are there to

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:35.679
buy things but there is so much more

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.120
potential for this algorithms to just

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:41.520
make our life better without you know

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.520
like changing much about our

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.799
life I'm Chris Wiggins from associate

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:47.360
professor of Applied Mathematics at

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:48.919
Columbia I'm also the chief data

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.240
scientist of the New York Times the data

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:51.720
science team at the New York Times

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.760
develops and deploys machine learning

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.080
for Newsroom and business problems but I

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.880
would say the things that we do mostly

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.720
you don't see but it might be things

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.480
like personalization algorithm are

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.799
recommending different content and do

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.600
data scientists which is rather distinct

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:06.320
from the phrase computer scientist do

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.760
data scientists still think in terms of

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.760
algorithms as driving a lot of it oh

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.400
absolutely yeah in fact so in data

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.799
science and Academia often the role of

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.280
the algorithm is the optimization

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:17.840
algorithm that helps you find the best

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.039
model or the best description of a data

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.200
set okay in data science and industry

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:24.280
the goal often it's centered around an

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.280
algorithm which becomes a data product

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.280
right so a data scientist in Industry

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.000
might be developing and deploying the

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.200
algorithm which means not only

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.240
understanding the algorithm and its

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.760
statistical performance but also all of

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.360
the software engineering around systems

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.080
integration making sure that that

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.480
algorithm receives input that's reliable

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.640
and has output that's useful as well as

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.280
I would say the organizational

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.679
integration which is how does a

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.200
community of people like the set of

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:49.679
people working at the New York Times

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.919
integrate that algorithm into their

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:53.159
process interesting and I feel like AI

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:54.480
based startups are all their R and

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:56.280
certainly within Academia are there

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.000
connections between Ai and the world of

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.440
data science absolutely the algorithms

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.400
that there in can you connect those dots

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.640
for you're right that AI as a field has

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.240
really exploded I would say particularly

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.880
many people experienced a chatbot that

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.799
was really really good today when people

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.320
say I AI they're often thinking about

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:12.960
large language models or they're

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.559
thinking about generative AI or they

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.559
might be thinking about a chatbot one

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:18.559
thing to keep in mind is a chatbot is a

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:20.120
special case of generative AI which is a

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:22.200
special case of using large language

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.120
models which is a special case of using

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.200
machine learning generally which is what

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.679
most people mean by AI you may have

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.760
moments that are um what John kthy

00:20:28.679 --> 00:20:32.280
called look M No Hands results where you

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.760
do some fantastic trick and you're not

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.520
quite sure how it worked I think it's

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.760
still very much early days large

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.200
language models is still in the point of

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.919
what might be called alchemy that people

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.960
are building large language models

00:20:40.919 --> 00:20:44.440
without a real clear a priori sense of

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.240
what the right design is for a right

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.880
problem many people are trying different

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.960
things out often in large companies

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.840
where they can afford to have many

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.919
people trying things out seeing what

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.640
works publishing that instantiating it

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:56.679
as a product and that itself is part of

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.760
the scientific process I would think too

00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:59.200
yeah very much well science and

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.200
engineering because often you're

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.679
building a thing and the thing does

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.679
something amazing to large extent we are

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:08.440
still looking for basic theoretical

00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:10.320
results around why deep neural networks

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.440
generally work why are they able to

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.440
learn so well they're huge billions of

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.480
parameter models and it's difficult for

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.760
us to interpret how they are able to do

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.440
what they do and is this a good thing do

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.760
you think or an inevitable thing that we

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.240
the programmers we the computer

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.720
scientist the data science who are

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.400
inventing these things can't actually

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.320
explain how they work because I feel

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.919
like friends of mine industry even when

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.760
it's something simple and relatively

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:34.480
familiar like autocomplete they can't

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.240
actually tell me like why that name is

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.000
appearing at the top of the list whereas

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.360
years ago when these algorithms were

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.120
more deterministic and more procedural

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.279
you could even point to the line that

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.360
made that name bubble up to the top so

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:47.400
is this a good thing a bad thing that

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.520
we're sort of losing control perhaps in

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.679
some sense of the algorithm it has risks

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.120
I don't know that I would say that it's

00:21:50.679 --> 00:21:53.799
good or bad but I would say there's lots

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.480
of scientific precedent there are times

00:21:53.799 --> 00:21:57.159
when an algorithm works really well and

00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.159
we have finite understanding of why it

00:21:57.159 --> 00:22:01.320
works or a model works really well and

00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:02.720
sometimes we have very little

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.559
understanding of why it works the way it

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.760
does in classes I teach certainly spend

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:08.080
a lot of time on fundamentals algorithms

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.840
that have been taught in classes for

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.760
decades now whether it's binary search

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.440
linear search bubble swort selection

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.880
sort or the like but are if we're

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.840
already at the point where I can pull up

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.720
chat GPT copy paste a whole bunch of

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.480
numbers or words and say sort these for

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.200
me does it really matter how chat GPT is

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.039
sorting it does it really matter to me

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.320
as the user how the software is sorting

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:31.080
it like do the fundamentals become more

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.919
dated and less important do you think

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.480
now you're talking about the ways in

00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:38.120
which code and computation is a special

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.799
case of Technology right so for driving

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.720
a car you may not necessarily need to

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:44.159
know much about organic chemistry even

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.120
if if the organic chemistry is how the

00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:48.320
car works right so you can drive the car

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.159
and use it in different ways without

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.880
understanding much about the

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:52.159
fundamentals so similarly with

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.320
computation we're at a point where the

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:56.039
computation is so high level right as

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.200
you you know you can import pyit learn

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:58.960
and you can go from zero to machine

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.640
learning and 30 seconds it's depending

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.880
on what level you want to understand the

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.000
technology where in the stack so to

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.679
speak um it's possible to understand it

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.760
and make wonderful things and Advance

00:23:06.679 --> 00:23:10.240
the world without understanding it at

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.919
the particular level of somebody who

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.600
actually might have originally designed

00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:14.480
the actual optimization algorithm I

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.279
should say though for many of the

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.000
optimization algorithms there are cases

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:20.559
where an algorithm works really well and

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.159
we publish a paper and there's a proof

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:23.360
in the paper and then years later people

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:24.799
realize actually that prove was wrong

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.840
and we're really still not sure why that

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:28.720
optimization works but it works really

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:32.039
well or it inspires people to make new

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:34.039
optimization algorithms so I I do think

00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:36.159
that the the goal of understanding

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:38.000
algorithms is Loosely coupled to our

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:39.559
progress in advancing grade algorithms

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.440
but they don't always necessarily have

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:43.559
to require each other and for those

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.320
students especially or even adults who

00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:47.120
are thinking of now steering into

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.039
computer science into programming who

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.760
were really jazzed about heading in that

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:53.080
direction up until for instance November

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.640
of 2022 when all of a sudden for many

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.120
people it looked like the world was now

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.679
changing and now maybe this isn't such a

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.960
promising path this isn't such a

00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:03.919
lucrative path anymore are llms are

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.320
tools like chat GPT reason not to

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:06.520
perhaps steer into the field large

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.720
language models are a particular

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.720
architecture for predicting let's say

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.679
the next word or a set of tokens more

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.080
generally the algorithm comes in when

00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:19.159
you think about how is that llm to be

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:22.960
trained or also how to be fine-tuned so

00:24:19.159 --> 00:24:24.799
the P of GPT is a pre-trained algorithm

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.399
the idea is that you train a large

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:30.039
language model on some Corpus of text

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:32.760
could be encyclopedias or textbooks or

00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:35.039
what have you and then you might want to

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.440
fine-tune that model around some

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:39.960
particular task or some particular

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.000
subset of texts so both of those are

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.840
examples of training algorithms so I

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.200
would say people's perception of

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.320
artificial intelligence has really

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:51.039
changed a lot in the last 6 months

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.679
particularly around November of 2022

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:54.559
when people experienced a really good

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:56.559
chatbot the technology though had been

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:58.480
around already before academics had

00:24:56.559 --> 00:25:01.320
already been working with chat gpt3

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.120
before that and GPT 2 and gpt1 and and

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.520
for many people it sort of opened up

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.919
this conversation about what is

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.120
artificial intelligence and what could

00:25:05.919 --> 00:25:08.799
we do with this and what are the

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.360
possible good and bad right like any

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:12.520
other piece of technology cransberg

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.360
first law of technology technology is

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.840
neither good nor bad nor is it neutral

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.559
every time we have some new technology

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.360
we should think about its capabilities

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:22.440
and the good and the possible bad as

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.399
with any area of study algorithms offer

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.840
a spectrum from the most basic to the

00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:28.399
most advanced and even if right now the

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.880
most advanced of the those algorithms

00:25:28.399 --> 00:25:31.760
feels Out Of Reach because you just

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.880
don't have that background with each

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.080
lesson you learn with each algorithm you

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:38.320
study that endgame becomes closer and

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.399
closer such that it will before long be

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.480
accessible to you and you will be at the

00:25:40.399 --> 00:25:45.600
end of that most advanced
